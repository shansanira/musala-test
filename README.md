# musala-test

this code is connected to database instance in mongodb atlas. on wild card ip address. simply runing `yarn`, then `yarn start` will startup the project.
dummy data is already in the atlas and necessary details to safly connect to the db is included in `.env` file. don't need to manually add anything since
`yarn start` will be run on nodemon with `env-variables`
